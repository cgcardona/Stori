   - The app will launch with placeholder data

### 🧪 Running Tests

#### **Blockchain Tests**
```bash
cd blockchain

# Test both STEM and Marketplace contracts
node scripts/run-all-tests-direct.js

# Test only STEM contract
node scripts/run-all-tests-direct.js --stem

# Test only Marketplace contract  
node scripts/run-all-tests-direct.js --marketplace
```

#### **Swift Tests**
```bash
# Unit tests
xcodebuild test -scheme TellUrStoriDAW -destination 'platform=macOS'

# UI tests
xcodebuild test -scheme TellUrStoriDAWUITests -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

#### **AI Service Tests**

cd musicgen-service
source venv/bin/activate

# Run Python tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Test generation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "upbeat electronic music", "duration": 10}'
```

### 🔧 Service Management

#### **Service Endpoints**
When all services are running, you'll have:

- **Swift DAW**: Native macOS application
- **AI Service**: `http://localhost:8000` (MusicGen API)
- **Blockchain L1**: `http://127.0.0.1:XXXXX/ext/bc/.../rpc` (Avalanche subnet)
- **GraphQL Indexer**: `http://localhost:4000/graphql` (Blockchain data API)

#### **Managing Background Services**

**Start Services:**
```bash
# Start AI service in background
cd musicgen-service
source venv/bin/activate
nohup python -m app.main > ai-service.log 2>&1 &

# Start GraphQL indexer in background
cd ../indexer-service
nohup node marketplace-graphql-server.js > indexer.log 2>&1 &
```

**Check Running Services:**
```bash
# Check what's running on each port
lsof -i :8000  # AI service
lsof -i :4000  # GraphQL indexer

# Check process by name
ps aux | grep "marketplace-graphql-server"
ps aux | grep "python -m app.main"
```

**Stop Services:**
```bash
# Kill by port
kill $(lsof -t -i:4000)  # Stop GraphQL indexer
kill $(lsof -t -i:8000)  # Stop AI service

# Or kill by process name
pkill -f "marketplace-graphql-server"
pkill -f "python -m app.main"

# Stop Avalanche network
avalanche network stop
```

**View Logs:**
```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f indexer-service/indexer.log
tail -f musicgen-service/ai-service.log
```

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

#### **Common Issues**

1. **Avalanche CLI Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clean and restart network
   avalanche network clean
   avalanche blockchain deploy tellurstoridaw --local
   ```

2. **Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # If MusicGen installation fails
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Node.js Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clear npm cache and reinstall
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

4. **GraphQL Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify indexer is connecting to correct RPC
   # Update RPC URL in indexer-service/marketplace-graphql-server.js
   # Restart the indexer service
   ```

### 📊 Verifying Full Setup

After completing all steps, verify everything is working:

1. **Check AI Service**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for API documentation
2. **Check Blockchain**: Run `node scripts/run-all-tests-direct.js` (should show 100% pass rate)
3. **Check Indexer**: Visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql` for GraphQL playground
4. **Check Swift App**: Marketplace should show real STEMs and data from blockchain

### 🎵 Data Population

The setup automatically populates your blockchain with:
- **51 diverse STEM tokens** (Electronic, Hip Hop, Rock, Pop, etc.)
- **Real marketplace listings** with various price points
- **Transaction history** and activity data
- **Creator profiles** and royalty information

### Development Workflow

1. **Branch Strategy**: Use feature branches for development
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Code Style**: Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
   - Use meaningful, descriptive names
   - Leverage Swift's type system
   - Follow MVVM architecture patterns

3. **Testing**: Write tests for all business logic
   ```bash
   # Run tests in Xcode
   Cmd+U
   ```

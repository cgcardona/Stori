# 🤖 Agent Onboarding Guide - TellUrStori V2 DAW

*Complete guide for new coding agents joining the TellUrStori V2 development project*

## 🎯 Project Context

You are working on **TellUrStori V2**, an innovative digital audio workstation that combines:
- **Professional DAW functionality** in Swift/SwiftUI for macOS
- **AI music generation** using Meta's AudioCraft MusicGen (Python backend)
- **NFT tokenization** of STEMs on custom Avalanche L1 blockchain
- **Comprehensive marketplace** for trading music NFTs

## 📍 Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### ✅ **What We've Built (December 2024)**

**Phase 1: DAW MVP Foundation - COMPLETE**
- Complete visual DAW interface with professional styling
- Multi-track timeline, mixer console, and transport controls
- Comprehensive data models and MVVM architecture
- Real-time audio engine foundation using AVFoundation
- Project management and persistence architecture
- Organized modular codebase structure

### 🔄 **Current State: UI-First Architecture**

**IMPORTANT**: The current implementation is **intentionally non-interactive**. We built the complete visual interface first, and Phase 1.5/2 will wire up the functionality.

**What Works:**
- ✅ Visual interface renders perfectly
- ✅ Professional DAW layout and styling
- ✅ Complete data models and architecture
- ✅ Builds and runs successfully on macOS

**What Doesn't Work (By Design):**
- 🔄 Volume/pan sliders don't move
- 🔄 Mute/solo buttons don't toggle
- 🔄 Transport controls don't play audio
- 🔄 Track creation button doesn't add tracks
- 🔄 Audio regions can't be dragged
- 🔄 Project save/load not functional

**This is the correct approach** - we have a solid foundation ready for functionality implementation.

- **Git** for version control

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone and open project
git clone [repository-url]
cd TellUrStoriDAW
open TellUrStoriDAW.xcodeproj

# Build and run (Cmd+R in Xcode)
# App should launch with complete DAW interface
```

### Current Git Status
- **Branch**: `phase-1` (or `main`)
- **Last Commit**: Phase 1 complete with full DAW interface
- **Status**: Clean working directory, ready for Phase 1.5/2 development

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Swift 6** with modern concurrency (async/await)
- **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- **MVVM architecture** with ObservableObject
- **Descriptive naming** following Apple's guidelines

### Architecture Patterns
- **ObservableObject** for view models (AudioEngine, ProjectManager)
- **@Published** properties for UI state updates
- **Dependency injection** through initializers
- **Protocol-oriented** design for testability

### Audio Development
- **Real-time safe** code in audio callbacks
- **No memory allocation** in audio render threads
- **AVFoundation** for audio processing
- **Core Audio** for low-level operations

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for audio pipeline
- **UI tests** for critical user flows
- **Performance tests** for audio latency

## 🔍 Key Files to Understand

### 1. AudioEngine.swift - Core Audio Processing
```swift
@MainActor
class AudioEngine: ObservableObject {
    @Published var transportState: TransportState = .stopped
    @Published var currentPosition: PlaybackPosition = PlaybackPosition()
    
    // Methods to implement in Phase 1.5/2:
    func play() { /* Wire to AVAudioEngine */ }
    func pause() { /* Implement pause logic */ }
    func stop() { /* Stop and reset position */ }
}
```

### 2. ProjectManager.swift - Project Operations
```swift
@MainActor
class ProjectManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentProject: AudioProject?
    @Published var recentProjects: [AudioProject] = []
    
    // Methods to implement:
    func createNewProject(name: String, tempo: Double) { /* Create and save */ }
    func loadProject(_ project: AudioProject) { /* Load from file */ }
    func saveCurrentProject() { /* Persist to disk */ }
}
```

### 3. MainDAWView.swift - Primary Interface
```swift
struct MainDAWView: View {
    @StateObject private var audioEngine = AudioEngine()
    @StateObject private var projectManager = ProjectManager()
    
    // Complete visual layout with:
    // - Timeline, mixer, and transport integration
    // - Sheet management for dialogs
    // - Toolbar with project operations
}
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Don't Break the Architecture**
- Maintain MVVM separation
- Keep UI logic in views, business logic in view models
- Don't put audio processing in SwiftUI views

### 2. **Audio Threading**
- Never allocate memory in audio callbacks
- Use real-time safe code only
- Test audio latency regularly

### 3. **State Management**
- Use @Published for UI-bound state
- Keep audio state separate from UI state
- Avoid circular dependencies

### 4. **Performance**
- Profile audio code with Instruments
- Keep UI updates on main thread
- Optimize for real-time audio processing

## 💡 Pro Tips for New Agents

1. **Start Small**: Wire up one control at a time rather than trying to implement everything
2. **Test Early**: Audio bugs are hard to debug, so test frequently
3. **Use Instruments**: Profile audio performance from the beginning
4. **Read Apple Docs**: AVFoundation and Core Audio documentation is essential
5. **Think Real-Time**: Always consider audio thread safety in your implementations

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Swift 6** with modern concurrency (async/await)
- **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- **MVVM architecture** with ObservableObject
- **Descriptive naming** following Apple's guidelines

### Architecture Patterns
- **ObservableObject** for view models (AudioEngine, ProjectManager)
- **@Published** properties for UI state updates
- **Dependency injection** through initializers
- **Protocol-oriented** design for testability

### Audio Development
- **Real-time safe** code in audio callbacks
- **No memory allocation** in audio render threads
- **AVFoundation** for audio processing
- **Core Audio** for low-level operations

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for audio pipeline
- **UI tests** for critical user flows
- **Performance tests** for audio latency

## 🔍 Key Files to Understand

### 1. AudioEngine.swift - Core Audio Processing
```swift
@MainActor
class AudioEngine: ObservableObject {
    @Published var transportState: TransportState = .stopped
    @Published var currentPosition: PlaybackPosition = PlaybackPosition()
    
    // Methods to implement in Phase 1.5/2:
    func play() { /* Wire to AVAudioEngine */ }
    func pause() { /* Implement pause logic */ }
    func stop() { /* Stop and reset position */ }
}
```

### 2. ProjectManager.swift - Project Operations
```swift
@MainActor
class ProjectManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentProject: AudioProject?
    @Published var recentProjects: [AudioProject] = []
    
    // Methods to implement:
    func createNewProject(name: String, tempo: Double) { /* Create and save */ }
    func loadProject(_ project: AudioProject) { /* Load from file */ }
    func saveCurrentProject() { /* Persist to disk */ }
}
```

### 3. MainDAWView.swift - Primary Interface
```swift
struct MainDAWView: View {
    @StateObject private var audioEngine = AudioEngine()
    @StateObject private var projectManager = ProjectManager()
    
    // Complete visual layout with:
    // - Timeline, mixer, and transport integration
    // - Sheet management for dialogs
    // - Toolbar with project operations
}
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Don't Break the Architecture**
- Maintain MVVM separation
- Keep UI logic in views, business logic in view models
- Don't put audio processing in SwiftUI views

### 2. **Audio Threading**
- Never allocate memory in audio callbacks
- Use real-time safe code only
- Test audio latency regularly

### 3. **State Management**
- Use @Published for UI-bound state
- Keep audio state separate from UI state
- Avoid circular dependencies

### 4. **Performance**
- Profile audio code with Instruments
- Keep UI updates on main thread
- Optimize for real-time audio processing

## 💡 Pro Tips for New Agents

1. **Start Small**: Wire up one control at a time rather than trying to implement everything
2. **Test Early**: Audio bugs are hard to debug, so test frequently
3. **Use Instruments**: Profile audio performance from the beginning
4. **Read Apple Docs**: AVFoundation and Core Audio documentation is essential
5. **Think Real-Time**: Always consider audio thread safety in your implementations
